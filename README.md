# JavaScript30 - Excercise 1: JS Drum Kit
## Bueller Board

This is a slightly customized version of the first excercise from [Wes Bos's JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/).

The site can be viewed on GithubPages [here](https://nealbrophy.github.io/js30-bueller-board/index.html) though the keypresses register a little slow at times. For better performance clone the repo and run it locally.
